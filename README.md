**Wildlife Simulation**, _will simulate the behaviour of a group of simple-minded and greedy creatures_. 

The simulation will start with a number of creatures and food that spawn at various locations. Each creature will know the location
of the food with the best quality, and they all will march towards it. The first creature to arrive at the location with
food will consume it. At different times during the simulation, I will introduce additional food supplies to the
region. The creatures will race and fight against each other to survive by consuming the food resources scattered
around.

- Output is the locations of the creatures at the moment but it will be updated with great GUI as we can see in the GIF:
